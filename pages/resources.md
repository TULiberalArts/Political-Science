The College of Liberal Arts has a number of resources available for political science degree students. Check out our two [affiliated centers](#affiliated-centers) for public policy research and community outreach. If you enroll as a student, we also encourage you to attend the [Featherman Lecture Series](#featherman-lecture-series), which addresses major public policy issues.

## Affiliated Centers

Our research particularly focuses on Philadelphia, the greater metropolitan area and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

## Featherman Lecture Series
