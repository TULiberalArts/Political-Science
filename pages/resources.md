## Undergraduate Internships

The Department of Political Science encourages students to pursue internships that help them gain valuable insights and experience from the public and private sectors with relevance for the study of politics. Through generous gifts from its supporters, the Department makes awards to students who secure appropriate internships. The awards are intended to off-set costs associated with taking on unpaid internships that do not lead to academic credit.

### Instructions:

Applications to departmental internships awards are solicited in March ever year. Completed applications will include a statement describing how an internship will further the candidate’s studies, a list of organizations to which students have or will apply, a resume, a transcript, and a letter of recommendation. More details are available with award announcements, and by [emailing the Undergraduate Chair](http://www.cla.temple.edu/politicalscience/undergraduate/contacts/) of Political Science.

1. **Paul Tully Intern Scholarship**

Established to honor the political life and career of Paul Tully, this award funds students who will complete an internship in government or with a political organization in Washington, D.C.
Paul Tully was a political strategist who served as political director of the Democratic National Committee and as advisor to several political campaigns. He worked among others for George McGovern, Edward Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, and Michael Dukakis. At his untimely passing in 1992 at the young age of 48, Paul Tully was deeply engaged in Governor Bill Clinton’s campaign for the White House.
The Paul Tully Intern Scholarship helps students defray costs associated with completing an internship in Washington, D.C. for a minimum period of six weeks. The award is $1,500.

3. **Political Science Advisory Board Internship Awards**

These awards fund majors who complete an internship in local, national, or international organization for a minimum of eight weeks.  Preference in selection is given to students who are completing an unpaid internship. The award is $1,000.
