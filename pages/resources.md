## Undergraduate Internships

The Department of Political Science encourages students to pursue internships that help them gain valuable insights and experience from the public and private sectors with relevance for the study of politics. Through generous gifts from its supporters, the department makes awards to students who secure appropriate internships. The awards are intended to off-set costs associated with taking on unpaid internships that do not lead to academic credit.

### Instructions

Applications to departmental internships awards are solicited in March ever year. Completed applications will include a statement describing how an internship will further the candidate’s studies, a list of organizations to which students have or will apply, a resume, a transcript and a letter of recommendation. More details are available with award announcements, and by [emailing the Undergraduate Chair](mailto:hfd@temple.edu).

**Paul Tully Intern Scholarship**

Established to honor the political life and career of Paul Tully, this award funds students who will complete an internship in government or with a political organization in Washington, D.C.

Paul Tully was a political strategist who served as political director of the Democratic National Committee and as advisor to several political campaigns. He worked among others for George McGovern, Edward Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Walter Mondale, Gary Hart and Michael Dukakis. At his untimely passing in 1992 at the young age of 48, Paul Tully was deeply engaged in Governor Bill Clinton’s campaign for the White House.

The Paul Tully Intern Scholarship helps students defray costs associated with completing an internship in Washington, D.C. for a minimum period of six weeks. The award is $1,500.

**William Allen Jones Experiential Learning Award**

The award is $1,000.

**Political Science Advisory Board Internship Awards**

These awards were established and funded through the generous support of the Political Science Advisory Board. The board is comprised of alums and friends of the department who wish to help current political science majors complete internships in the course of their studies. These awards fund majors who complete an internship in local, national, or international organization for a minimum of eight weeks. Preference in selection is given to students who are completing an unpaid internship. The award is $1,000.

## The Washington Semester

Students have the opportunity to participate in the Washington Semester, earning credit while interning in D.C. at places like the U.S. House of Representatives, the Smithsonian and the Washington Post. See the department for details.

## Undergraduate Honors Program

### Political Science Honors Program and Distinction in the Major

The political science honors program is designed to give highly motivated political science students the opportunity to take academically rigorous honors seminars with other honors students and to acquire the skills necessary to undertake in-depth independent research on topics of interest. The department’s honors program deepens the information literacy goals of the general education requirement and is excellent preparation for graduate school.

Political science majors who have completed their sophomore year with a 3.5 GPA or above are eligible to be members of the departmental honors program. Departmental honors students are allowed to take the junior (POLI 3996) and senior (POLI 4996) capstone.  Students who pass both capstones with a B or better will graduate with distinction in the major.  In addition, POLI 3996 counts as an upper-level elective and writing intensive course and POLI 4996 counts as the senior capstone requirement.

### Admission into the Departmental Honors Program

Eligible students will be contacted via email in the spring semester. Students who believe they are eligible for the program but who were not contacted are encouraged to contact the political science honors director, Heath Fogg Davis [hfd@temple.edu](mailto:hfd@temple.edu).

### University Honors Program

Students accepted into the [University Honors Scholar Program](http://www.temple.edu/honors/) may select political science as their field of concentration, thus becoming a member of the political science honors program. University honors students who are interested in earning distinction in the major should take the junior and senior honors capstone course, as described above. University honors students who do not wish to pursue distinction in the major should, nonetheless, sign up for POLI 4996 as their capstone.

### University Honors Scholar Track

University honors students may become honors scholars by choosing to develop and complete an honors project in the form of a thesis. Political science university honors students who complete the university honors program’s course requirements plus an honors thesis graduate with an honors scholar designation on their transcript. Those who do not complete an honors thesis but satisfy all honors requirements graduate with an honors certificate designation on their transcript.

The thesis proposal is submitted to the university honors program, preferably by the beginning of the second semester of the junior year. All proposals are due by the end of junior year, and are reviewed by the honors director and the student’s faculty advisor. Thesis topics may emerge from coursework (e.g., the capstone), an independent study or curiosity about some other facet of the study of politics. The completed thesis must be at least 8,000 words exclusive of footnotes and bibliography. The thesis can serve as the core of a student’s dossier as she or he applies for graduate school.

The university honors program maintains a set of minimal progress standards that every honors student must satisfy in order to continue in the program. Students failing to make satisfactory progress are placed on probation and may ultimately be dismissed from the program. Students who are interested in learning more about joining the University Honors Program are encouraged to contact the university honors director, Ruth Ost at [rost@temple.edu](mailto:rost@temple.edu). 

### Funding and Support

Funds are available in the [Diamond Research Scholars program](http://www.temple.edu/vpus/opportunities/ResearchScholars.htm).

Honors students are also encouraged to submit their completed thesis to the [Library Prize for Undergraduate Research](http://guides.temple.edu/content.php?pid=155082&sid=1314496).

## Handbook

Attention: The following information is for political science majors declared after August 26, 2005. For those declared prior to that date, the old requirements apply.

### Introduction

The undergraduate manual is intended as a guide for political science majors and minors. It contains information on requirements for the major and minor, advising services available to you, suggestions for selecting an overall program of study as well as for choosing specific courses, and an overview of special programs.

I. **Advising**

It is important that you plan your program with the assistance of an advisor to ensure that you are fully aware of the opportunities open to you and to ensure that you follow a course of study that fits your needs and goals.

One of the most important occasions (though surely not the only one) when you want to talk to an advisor is when you register (or priority register) for a semester. The best way to register is to make tentative selections before you see your advisor and be prepared to explain to the advisor why these courses make the most sense for you. Be sure to have your DARS form handy when you see your advisor. Keep in mind that you are ultimately responsible for your own academic program. Here are some questions you might want to think about before you see your advisor:

- Do these courses help you make progress toward meeting your degree requirements?
- Have you taken all the necessary pre-requisites for these courses?
- Do these courses help prepare you for what you plan to do after graduation?
- Do some of these courses build on what you have learned before?

SENIORS: Students registering for their senior year must go to Academic Advising for a “pre-graduate review.” This process will ensure that you have fulfilled the necessary requirements to graduate.

TRANSFERS: Transfer students are strongly encouraged to see the chair of undergraduate studies in the Political Science Department as soon as they receive a statement of how their previous credits transfer to Temple . The department can help students interpret the special requirements that often apply to transfer students as well as help them evaluate how their classes transferred in political science. The sooner you make this appointment, the better off you will be. We can help students with important concerns about their transfer credits.

A faculty advisor in the department is the best place to come for general advising about your program at Temple, but keep in mind that there are a variety of other sources you can turn to for advising of various kinds:

- Internship Coordinator - for information on internships and general advising for students in the department. For 2016-17 – Dr. John S. Masker (mailto:jsmasker@temple.edu).
- [Academic Advising Center](http://liberalarts.temple.edu/advising) - for information about programs and courses outside the department and College of Liberal Arts or University policy.
- [Career Services](http://www.temple.edu/provost/careercenter/) - for advising about your plans after graduation.
- [Pre-Law Advisor](http://www.cla.temple.edu/prelaw/) – for those interested in a legal career, or information about law school. 

University honors and double majors: please be aware that the department may not have a copy of your DARS form. Please bring a copy of your student DARS with you for advising if you fall into one of those categories.

II. **Special Programs**

Honors Programs: there are two distinct honors programs for undergraduates. One is the Departmental Honor Program in which Political Science majors are eligible to take particular honors classes and graduate with distinction in the major.  The other is the University Honors Program in which students are also eligible to graduate with distinction in the major but can also pursue the Honors Certificate Program.  For more information visit [here](http://www.cla.temple.edu/politicalscience/undergraduate/honors-program/).

Cooperative Education Program: the Cooperative Education Program at Temple is designed to provide experience in an actual job situation for which the student earns academic credit when their work is done in conjunction with academic supervision. Interested students should see the Coop Coordinator for more information: For 2013-2014 – Dr. Alistair Howard (alistair@temple.edu).

Pre-law Curriculum: Political Science is one of the most popular majors for pre-law students. Although law schools neither give preference to any particular choice of major nor require any specific undergraduate courses, they do make some general recommendations about getting a sound Liberal Arts education. Students should visit the [CLA website](http://www.cla.temple.edu/prelaw/), for more information. First, develop skill in communicating your ideas in both written and spoken form. Courses in composition, literature, speech, and other humanities and social sciences can help you improve these skills, which are essential to success in law school and in the profession of law. Second, sharpen your analytical abilities. Take courses that challenge you to think logically. Courses in mathematics, science, computer programming, logic, argumentation, philosophy, literature, other humanities and social sciences should help you develop your powers of critical thinking. Third, law schools suggest that you acquire in-depth understanding of at least one social science (in your case Political Science).Finally, some knowledge of business structure and terminology may be useful once you are in law school. Accounting and/or economics are therefore useful to some pre-law students.

Temple Abroad: Temple provides a number of opportunities for students to study in foreign countries. The opportunities to live in, and meet people from, other cultures, to see different countries, and to learn a foreign language while earning credit towards the degree, can greatly enrich the undergraduate experience. The [Office of International Programs](www.temple.edu/studyabroad/programs/index.html):(200 Tuttleman Learning Center, ext. 0720) has information on a variety of programs. Students considering study abroad should contact this office. Examples of study abroad locations include Tokyo, Rome, Israel, London, Paris, Germany, Ghana, and Mexico.

Political Economy Program: The Department of Political Science and the Department of Economics offer an interdisciplinary program leading to a Certificate in Political Economy. Because the program focuses on the interaction between government and the economy, the program is ideal preparation for students planning careers in either the public or private sector. It also provides an excellent foundation for graduate studies in law, the social sciences, and public administration. The program is open to all matriculated students in the University. Contact [Dr. Richard Deeg](mailto:rdeeg@temple.edu) or see here in the online bulletin for specific details and requirements.

III. **Student Organizations**

**The Political Science Majors Association:** The Political Science Majors Association is the organization of all Political Science majors at Temple University . The primary purpose of the Association is to relay the Undergraduate Major’s opinions and interests in the Political Science Department and in the College of Liberal Arts. The Association has sponsored various activities for the Undergraduate major including: career forums, lectures, student and faculty mixers, law and graduate forums, seminars on popular topics, and trips to Harrisburg.

Pi Sigma Alpha Pi Sigma Alpha, the national Political Science Honor Society, exists for the purpose of conferring honor on those students who have distinguished themselves in the field of Political Science. Inquiries about membership in Pi Sigma Alpha should be directed to the faculty advisor of Pi Sigma Alpha, [Dr. Robin Kolodny](mailto:rhsueh@temple.edu).

IV. **Faculty**
