## Political Science Advisory Board

The mission and role of the Political Science Advisory Board (PSAB) is to identify resources for students studying with the Department of Political Science. This includes discovering and expanding internships and other undergraduate and graduate career opportunities; counseling students on best practices to develop their professional network and achieve success in the job market; and raising external funding for Political Science Advisory Board Internship Awards.

## Undergraduate Internships

The Department of Political Science encourages students to pursue internships that help them gain valuable insights and experience from the public and private sectors with relevance for the study of politics. Through generous gifts from its supporters, the Department makes awards to students who secure appropriate internships. The awards are intended to off-set costs associated with taking on unpaid internships that do not lead to academic credit.

### Instructions:

Applications to departmental internships awards are solicited in March ever year. Completed applications will include a statement describing how an internship will further the candidate’s studies, a list of organizations to which students have or will apply, a resume, a transcript, and a letter of recommendation. More details are available with award announcements, and by [emailing the Undergraduate Chair](mailto:hfd@temple.edu).

**Paul Tully Intern Scholarship**

Established to honor the political life and career of Paul Tully, this award funds students who will complete an internship in government or with a political organization in Washington, D.C.


Paul Tully was a political strategist who served as political director of the Democratic National Committee and as advisor to several political campaigns. He worked among others for George McGovern, Edward Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, and Michael Dukakis. At his untimely passing in 1992 at the young age of 48, Paul Tully was deeply engaged in Governor Bill Clinton’s campaign for the White House.


The Paul Tully Intern Scholarship helps students defray costs associated with completing an internship in Washington, D.C. for a minimum period of six weeks. The award is $1,500.

**William Allen Jones Experiential Learning Award**

Established to honor William Allen Jones, a long-term supporter of the Political Science Department, this award funds Political Science majors who complete an internship in local, national, or international governmental offices or political organizations, for a minimum of six weeks. The award is $1,000.

**Political Science Advisory Board Internship Awards**

These awards were established and funded through the generous support of the Political Science Advisory Board. The Board is comprised of alums and friends of the department who wish to help current political science majors complete internships in the course of their studies. These awards fund majors who complete an internship in local, national, or international organization for a minimum of eight weeks. Preference in selection is given to students who are completing an unpaid internship. The award is $1,000.
