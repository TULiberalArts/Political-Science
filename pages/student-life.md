At the College of Liberal Arts, your pursuit of a Political Science degree may start in the classroom, but it doesn’t end there. Make the most of your education by taking on an [internship](#undergraduate-internships), spending a [semester in Washington, D.C.](#the-washington-semester) or [Harrisburg](#pennsylvania-capital-semester), joining the [Political Science Society](#the-political-science-society) or [Pi Sigma Alpha](#pi-sigma-alpha) or even [studying abroad](#study-abroad)! Finally, exceptional students are eligible for various departmental and CLA awards and scholarships, which are listed on the [College of Liberal Arts Awards and Scholarships](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/about-us/resources/awards-and-scholarships?field_awards_department_nid=4583&field_awards_academics_class_value=All) page.

## Undergraduate Internships
[Internships](https://www.cla.temple.edu/professional-development/internships/) comprise an integral part of the major experience. CLA students are permitted to earn up to 12 credit hours through internships. In our department, however, students can further use six of those credit hours to replace two upper-level courses (POLS 2000-4999) for their major or minor degrees. There are two common ways of undertaking internships. One path consists of the Harrisburg and Washington Semesters, which provide financial assistance and placement into relevant government-related positions (below). 
The other path is to secure internships individually. By working closely with our Internship Coordinator and CLA Advising, students can ensure they earn eligible credit hours through organizations relevant to their interests. Political science interns demonstrating excellence and need are eligible for financial assistance from the Paul Tully Award, McKenna Memorial Award, and Political Science Alumni Board Award, which are administered by the department.

For more information, please consult the Internship Coordinator [Erin Dwyer](mailto:erin.dwyer@temple.edu).

## Pennsylvania Capital Semester
Many students interested in local and state politics pursue an [internship semester in Harrisburg](http://www.cla.temple.edu/institute-for-public-affairs/the-pennsylvania-capital-semester/). In close cooperation with Temple’s Harrisburg campus, students are placed in various branches of state government and related institutions. Alumni of the program often return to Harrisburg to work in exciting jobs after graduating due to the networking opportunities it provides. Enrollment in the program comes with a financial stipend. For more information, please consult the Internship Coordinator.

## The Washington Semester
[The Washington Semester](https://www.cla.temple.edu/institute-for-public-affairs/the-washington-semester/) places students in internships in our nation’s capital through close collaboration with [The Washington Center](https://twc.edu/). Students work in varying fields, including not just political institutions like the House of Representatives but also public organizations in the arts, business, international relations, journalism, environment, and other fields. They also undertake coursework through the TWC. Enrollment in the program comes with a financial stipend. For more information, please consult the Internship Coordinator.

## The Political Science Society
The Political Science Society welcomes all students taking political science coursework at Temple University. As an inclusive student organization, it sponsors exciting weekly and monthly activities including career forums, lectures, student and faculty mixers, law and graduate forums, seminars on popular topics, and trips to locales like New York City and Washington, D.C. Interested students should consult the Society’s [website](https://pssoc5.wixsite.com/temple), [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TemplePSS/) or inquire directly at [pssoc@temple.edu](mailto:pssoc@temple.edu).

## Pi Sigma Alpha
[Pi Sigma Alpha](https://www.pisigmaalpha.org/) is the national political science honors society. It was founded in 1920 and now includes over 500 college and university chapters in the US. Temple houses the Delta Rho chapter, which hosts public events with support from the national office, collaborates with other chapters in Philadelphia, and supports scholarship and publication opportunities for members. The chapter recruit majors every semester based upon a minimum GPA (3.65) and credit requirement (75). Inquiries should be directed to the chapter advisor and [undergraduate chair](mailto:sean.yom@temple.edu).

## Study Abroad
Temple provides a number of opportunities for students to study abroad; to experience of living in, and meeting people from, other cultures; seeing different countries; and learning a foreign language. This can greatly enrich the undergraduate experience, particularly for political science majors studying international affairs and comparative politics. 

The Office of Education Abroad and Overseas Campuses (200 Tuttleman Learning Center; phone: [215-204-0720](tel:2152040720)) has information on a variety of programs abroad. Popular Temple study abroad locations include Tokyo, Rome, London, Paris, Germany (Tübingen and Hamburg) and Spain (Oviedo). Many Political Science majors opt to do a second major in [Global Studies](http://www.cla.temple.edu/global-studies/) which has a “regional enrichment” requirement of study abroad or additional coursework. For more information on study abroad and the Global Studies major visit the Study Abroad [website](http://studyabroad.temple.edu/).
