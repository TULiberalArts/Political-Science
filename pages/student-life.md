At the College of Liberal Arts, your pursuit of a Political Science degree may start in the classroom, but it doesn’t end there. Make the most of your education by taking on an [internship](#undergraduate-internships), spending a [semester in Washington, D.C.](#the-washington-semester), joining the [Political Science Society](#the-political-science-society) or [Pi Sigma Alpha](#pi-sigma-alpha) or even [studying abroad](#study-abroad). 

## Undergraduate Internships
The Department of Political Science encourages students to pursue internships that help them gain valuable insights and experience from the public and private sectors with relevance for political study. Through generous gifts from its supporters, the department makes awards to students who secure appropriate internships. The awards are intended to offset the costs of taking on unpaid internships that do not lead to academic credit.

Departmental internships awards applications are collected every March. Completed applications will include a statement describing how an internship will further your studies, a list of organizations to which students have or will apply, a resume, a transcript and a letter of recommendation. More details are available with award announcements and by emailing the undergraduate chair, [Dr. Sean Yom](mailto:sean.yom@temple.edu).

For a complete list of departmental and college level awards and scholarships you may be eligible for, please visit the [College of Liberal Arts Awards and Scholarships](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/about-us/resources/awards-and-scholarships?field_awards_department_nid=4583&field_awards_academics_class_value=All) page.

## The Washington Semester
Students have the opportunity to participate in the Washington Semester, earning credit while interning in D.C. at places like the U.S. House of Representatives, the Smithsonian and the Washington Post. See the department for details.

## The Political Science Society
The Political Science Society is the organization of all Political Science majors and minors at Temple University. The association represents the opinions and interests of Political Science undergraduate majors. The society sponsors activities including career forums, lectures, student and faculty mixers, law and graduate forums, seminars on popular topics, and trips to places like New York City and Washington, DC. If you are interested in information about Political Science Society, please send an email to [pssoc@temple.edu](mailto:pssoc@temple.edu).

## Pi Sigma Alpha
Pi Sigma Alpha is the national Political Science Honor Society. Students who have distinguished themselves in the field of political science are inducted. Inquiries about membership should be directed to the faculty advisor of Pi Sigma Alpha, [Dr. Sean Yom](mailto:sean.yom@temple.edu).

## Study Abroad
Temple provides a number of opportunities for students to study abroad; to experience of living in, and meeting people from, other cultures; seeing different countries; and learning a foreign language. This opportunity can greatly enrich the undergraduate experience. The Office of Education Abroad and Overseas Campuses (200 Tuttleman Learning Center; phone: [215-204-0720](tel:2152040720)) has information on a variety of programs abroad. Popular Temple study abroad locations include Tokyo, Rome, London, Paris, Germany (Tubigen and Hamburg) and Spain (Oviedo). Many Political Science majors opt to do a second major in [Global Studies](http://www.cla.temple.edu/global-studies/) which has a "regional enrichment" requirement of study abroad or additional coursework. For more information on study abroad and the Global Studies major visit the [Study Abroad](http://studyabroad.temple.edu/) website.
