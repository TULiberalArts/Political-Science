A major in Political Science is ideal for students interested in politics, international affairs, and important issues like health care, the environment and civil rights. Our students study political theories concerning the ideal government and how power and resources should be allocated in society.

Our faculty members are nationally recognized in their fields and continue to research and publish while teaching both introductory and advanced coursesâ€”all the while bringing their cutting edge research into the classroom.

We teach our students how to think, write, read and speak in ways that they can apply to a variety of careers and that will help them become more interested, engaged and capable citizens.
