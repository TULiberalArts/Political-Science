## Pioneering Research
 
Our research-oriented curriculum emphasizes academic knowledge, career preparation and citizenship in a democratic political system.

## Intern In Washington, D.C.

Students have the opportunity to participate in Temple’s Washington Semester, earning credit while interning in D.C. at places like the U.S. House of Representatives, the Smithsonian and the Washington Post.

## Political Science Internship Awards

The Department of Political Science encourages students to pursue internships that help them gain valuable insights and experience from the public and private sectors with relevance for the study of politics. Through generous gifts from its supporters, the department makes awards to students who secure appropriate internships. The awards are intended to off-set costs associated with taking on unpaid internships that do not lead to academic credit.

### Instructions:

Applications to departmental internships awards are solicited in March ever year. Completed applications will include a statement describing how an internship will further the candidate’s studies, a list of organizations to which students have or will apply, a resume, a transcript, and a letter of recommendation. More details are available with award announcements, and by emailing the undergraduate chair, Heath Fogg Davis at [hfd@temple.edu](mailto:hfd@temple.edu).
