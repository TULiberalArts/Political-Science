## Study Political Science’s Four Major Subfields
- In **American Politics**, faculty and students conduct research on political behavior, political institutions, public policy and urban politics.
- In **Comparative Politics**, faculty teach students about democratization, the role of the state in the economy, and political violence. Our faculty specialize in the politics of Africa, China, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.
- In **International Relations**, faculty and students apply the various theoretical approaches to the study of world politics, international security, international political economy, and the study of international organizations.
- In **Political Theory**, our strengths cluster around the research areas of late modernity; democratic and normative political theories - especially those pertaining to political questions of social and economic inequality - globalization, identity politics, and social movements; and the relationship between politics and religion.

## MA in Political Science
The terminal MA program gives you a broad education in the general field of political science. MA students also have the option to develop technical skills by completing the methods sequence. MA students typically apply their degree toward careers in the private or public sector.

## PhD in Political Science
The PhD program prepares students for careers in academia. We train our students to become successful scholars and teachers. PhD students complete the MA program requirements, take additional courses that help them specialize in particular fields of study and complete a methods sequence. Many of our PhDs pursue a career in academia, but some of our graduates also successfully apply their political science training to non-academic careers.

## Master of Public Policy (MPP)
Advance your career. Enhance your community. Develop the analytic skills needed to formulate and assess public policies and evaluate the effectiveness of government programs at the federal, state and local levels. Learn the “softer” skills of leadership and communicating your ideas in a political context. We train generalists who combine technical competency with a sophisticated understanding of the policy process. If you’re interested in social and quality-of-life issues throughout Philadelphia and beyond, Temple offers a graduate program in public policy led by full-time faculty and working practitioners.
