## Study Political Science’s Major Subfields
In American Politics, faculty and students conduct research on votingbehavior, political institutions, public opinion, urban politics and their instersection with race, gender and income.

In Comparative Politics, faculty specialize in the politics of Africa, China, Europe, India, Latin America, and the Middle East. Special attention is given to authoritarian stabiliy and democratization, political economy, the development of the state, and political parties. 

In International Relations, faculty and students study world politics, international security, international political economy, political violence and civil war, and international organizations.

Our program emphasizes political questions of social and economic inequality – globalization, identity politics and social movements – throughout the curriculum. Our courses in Political Theory examinedemocratic and normative political theories. 

## Master of Arts Political Science
The terminal MA program gives you a broad education in the general field of political science. MA students also have the option to develop technical skills by completing the political science department’s graduate methods sequence. MA students typically apply their degree toward careers in the private or public sector, while other proceed to PhD programs to pursue their academic interests.

## PhD in Political Science
The PhD program prepares students for careers in both academic and non-academic positions. We train our students to become successful scholars and teachers. PhD students satisfy the MA program requirements, take additional courses that help them specialize in particular fields of study and complete a methods sequence. Many of our PhDs pursue a career in academia, but some of our graduates also successfully apply their political science training to non-academic careers.

## Master of Public Policy (MPP)
Advance your career. Enhance your community. Develop the analytic skills needed to formulate and assess public policies and evaluate the effectiveness of government programs at the federal, state and local levels. Learn the “softer” skills of leadership and communicating your ideas in a political context. We train generalists who combine technical competency with a sophisticated understanding of the policy process. Temple’s graduate program in public policy is led by full-time faculty and working practitioners and is ideal for students interested in social and quality-of-life issues throughout Philadelphia and beyond.
