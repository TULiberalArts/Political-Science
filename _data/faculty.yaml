  bio: >
    My recent work has been devoted to a systematic calling into question of a pervasive set of dichotomies constitutive of Western  self-understanding. These dichotomies have been rationality/power,  truth/skepticism, belief/non-belief, religion/politics, infinity/finiteness. In a series of books and essays which is  continuing into the present, I have tried to theorize the ways in which the second-listed foil in each of these dichotomies partakes of many key characteristics of the term that it is officially serving as a  contrast to. “Power” is a rationally devised category to help flag the limitations of reason. Skepticism in its denials and renunciations is a theory of truth in its own right. The non-believer in any given set  of beliefs is simultaneously guided by another set of beliefs and  priorities that he might not be fully self-conscious about. Given the  fundamental premise of Western monotheistic religion that God is utterly transcendent and infinite, then religion from its formative period  through all subsequent generations consists of a series of power  assertions invoked to advance its principles and values. The very label of “infinite” applied to God delimits Him and militates against its  own content unless you translate vertical infinity into horizontal  terms, envisioning stretches of human time moving endlessly forward. The conceptual confusions residing in these dichotomies are reflected  and re-inscribed in theoretical and historical texts and the  interpretations they have spawned. In my own work, I have focused on  ancient, medieval, early modern, and late modern texts to try and get  hold of the thread at the right end and achieve enhanced coherence.

  bio: >
    My major area of interest, broadly defined, is urban politics. Born and raised in Brooklyn (which is still the 4th largest city!), I had an early education about urban areas that was shaped by some very practical activities – turning empty lots into playgrounds, keeping the hand ball court for hours, dodging traffic, and learning the subway lines. Over the years, this practical education morphed into a concern with issues of housing and community development, neighborhood politics and community organizations, political leadership and urban public policy, and, most recently, preserving education as a public good. While researching and writing on these topics, my fixation with the practical persisted. In 1997, I started the University Community Collaborative (formerly, the UCCP) in an effort to leverage some of the research and pedagogical expertise of the university for larger community ends. With a focus on youth leadership development, social justice, and community building, the Collaborative conducts direct programming, capacity building at the organizational and individual levels, and applied research activities in collaboration with community based and other nonprofit organizations. Working with some very talented, creative, and committed community leaders and young people prompted me to think more deeply and systematically about the university’s role in the community, about civic engagement as a tool for political empowerment, and about pedagogical approaches to preparing young people to live in a democratic society. My approach is interdisciplinary, relying on works from the various social sciences, and it is heavily informed by the “view from the street.” I encourage you to check out our website [www.UCCollab.org](http://www.uccollab.org/) to see what is possible when these perspectives come together. Be forewarned, our work is positively contagious!

Dr. Guisinger’s research broadly concerns information transmission between political and economic actors on issues pertaining to international security and economic relations. One strand focuses on how governments can most credibly signal intentions to other governments and to markets. A second strand focuses on public opinion toward government policies. Her work utilizes formal and informal models based on assumptions of rational decision making and strategic interactions and covers a diverse set of topics, including conflict escalation, financial crises, exchange rate regimes, trade policy, and capital regulations. In her current book project, Preferences without Politics: American Opinion on Trade, Dr. Guisinger builds upon her prior published research on the salience of trade to explain why trade policy, which once defined U.S. political parties, has fallen out of political discourse in recent campaigns."

    Joseph M. Schwartz is Professor of Political Science at Temple University. Schwartz chaired the department from 2000-2005. He teaches courses in the history of political thought; contemporary democratic theory; American political development; race and American politics; and the radical tradition (and its critics) in theory and practice. Schwartz’s teaching and published work focuses on the complex interaction among morality, ideology, and political and institutional development. He believes that political theory should not speak a ghettoized, jargon-laden “private language;” rather, it should inform public intellectual and political deliberation. He is a past recipient of the College of Liberal Arts Distinguished Teaching Award, Temple University’s Lindback Prize for Teaching Excellence, and the Temple University College of Liberal Arts Alumni Association Eleanor Hofkin Award for Excellence in Teaching. His first book, The Permanence of the Political: A Democratic Critique of the Radical Thrust to Transcend Politics(Princeton, 1995) critiques the radical longing for a society that transcends particular identity and the need for politics. The book won the North American Society for Social Philosophy Prize for the best book published in 1995. His second book, The Future of Democratic Equality: Reconstructing Social Solidarity in a Fragmented United States(Routledge 2009) cautions against a potential new form of radical orthodoxy: that universal forms of identity are repressive and homogenizing, whereas particular identities are inherently emancipatory. The work argues that defenders of a democratic conception of “difference” must not forget that “difference,” if constructed upon a terrain of radical social inequality, yields unjust inequalities in social and political power. Schwartz has also published numerous scholarly articles on topics ranging from just war theory and the war on terrorism to the challenges neo-liberal globalization poses for egalitarian politics and policy. He is currently working on a book on American exceptionalism, which argues that the development of the American socialist movement was hampered by it being one of the few not to be associated with a form of democratic patriotism. He has received numerous external fellowships to support his research, including a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) fellowship for university teachers to support the writing of The Future of Democratic Equality.  An American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) fellowship and a Mellon post-doctorate at Cornell University aided the completion of his first book, The Permanence of the Political. Schwartz received his PhD in Political Science from Harvard University and received his second B.A. at Oxford University (in Politics, Philosophy and Economics) as a recipient of a Marshall Scholarship.  As an undergraduate, he was a Telluride Scholar at Cornell University. Schwartz, beginning in high school with the anti-Vietnam War movement, has long been active on the democratic left, from the anti-apartheid movement in the 1970s and 1980s to the fight for a single-payer national health care system. He contributes to popular publications such as Dissent and In These Times. Schwartz serves as a Vice-Chair of the Democratic Socialists of America and is a member of its National Political Committee. (DSA, founded by the late social critic Michael Harrington, is the largest socialist organization in the United States.  Cornel West and Barbara Ehrenreich are among its Honorary Chairs.) Schwartz takes a particular interest in the work of students who are both trying to comprehend society and working to create a more just world. Schwartz is the parent of Michael Migiel-Schwartz, who will turn nineteen in August 2011 and who just completed his freshman year at Wesleyan University, where he is a left-wing student and a right-handed pitcher. Having parented his son in Ithaca New York, Schwartz still resides there May-August (the four reasons for being an academic – May, June, July, and August!) He is an expert on the social geography of the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and occasionally unintentionally kills deer without firing a shot (i.e, his car does the deed!). Born and bred in the Bronx, he is an inveterate Yankees fan – but he roots for “the workers,” not for owners!

    Sandra L. Suárez (Ph.D., Yale University, 1994) is Professor of Political Science. She specializes in the study of American and Comparative political economy and public policy in historical perspective. Suarez’ research deals with how political and economic actors shape the policymaking process and its outcomes across countries and over time. She has focused her attention principally on economic policymaking, zeroing in on critical junctures in search of patterns of behavior and interaction among the relevant formal and informal actors. She has conducted research on these topics in both developed and developing countries, employing primarily theory-driven process-tracing and case-study and small-sample methodologies. She has published work about business-government relationships, especially in the U.S., economic development policies, which involved a historical-comparative study of Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, the politics of the diffusion of the Internet and mobile telecommunications, and the politics of financial regulation and executive compensation. The overarching questions that unite her work are firmly rooted in the political economy tradition: in what ways do governments chose to intervene in the economy, what are the interests of formal and informal actors, and what are the political and economic trade-offs? Suarez’ work has been published in the Journal of Comparative Politics, Politics & Society, Social Forces, Studies in Comparative International Development and Telecommunications Policy. She has been awarded fellowships by the Ford Foundation, the Center for International Studies at the Woodrow Wilson School, the Institute for the Study of World Politics and the Juan March Foundation, Center for Advance Study in the Social Sciences in Madrid.

    I joined Temple University’s Political Science Department in 2000 as a Visiting Instructor. After finally finishing my dissertation at George Washington University, I became an Assistant Professor in 2005, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011 (on the ‘instructional’ track rather than research tenure track). My undergraduate degree is from Hertford College, Oxford (1988) and I completed my doctorate in 2004 at George Washington University. I have published in West European Politics, and contributed to the Oxford Companion to American Politics (edited by David Coates).  I teach political economy, comparative politics, political ideology, and public policy. My research interests include the politics of capitalism in liberal market economies, chiefly Britain and the United States, and the politics of international comparative argument. In January 2014 I was appointed Director of Assessment for the College of Liberal Arts. In addition I am the Undergraduate Advisor & Internship Coordinator for the Political Science Department. I serve on a number of committees at Temple, mostly reflecting my interest in university administration for internationalization and student-centered teaching. I am a member of the International Advisory Committee, formed by our new Senior Vice Provost for International Affairs as well as the University Senate Committee on International Programs. In Fall 2009 I served on the Provost’s Internationalization Laboratory Team, an American Council of Education Initiative, and have facilitated sessions for Temple’s International Educators Academy. Finally, I served for several years as an Area Coordinator in the Gen Ed Program, helping manage courses across the University in the World Societies area. Regardless of their major all Temple students are required to take at least one WS course. I have also taught public administration to graduate MPA students at the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania, and have taught Global Business Regulation for the International MBA program at the Fox School of Business.  Finally, I offered a course on Capitalism, Ideas and the American State for Temple’s Masters of Liberal Arts Program.
